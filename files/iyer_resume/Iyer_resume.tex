\textit{Phd Candidate} \hfill April 2023 | July 2024\\
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
	\item Employed machine learning methods (e.g., Lasso, Ridge, etc) to identify the most relevant variables out of a dataset with over 1000 variables and 23 million observations%, improving model accuracy and interpretability
	\item Deployed causal inference experiments (e.g. Diff-in-Diff) to uncover the impact of state-level policies (my work shows a 1\% increase in minimum wages leads to a 0.44\% increase in reservation wages)
	\item Compiled novel survey data on unemployment insurance recipients by establishing connections with the Bureau of Labor Statistics
	\item Processed 500k+ observations for experimental research design (e.g. combined multiple data sources, grouped and filtered observations, etc for Triple-diff designs, event studies, among others) in an HPC environment
	%\item Combined disparate data sets to produce choropleth maps, animations, tables, and time series plots
	\item Presented findings through academic articles, presentations, and visualizations (graphs, choropleth maps, etc) to inform decision-making and policy development at professional conferences
	%\item Utilized statistical software (e.g., R, Stata, etc) to conduct rigorous econometric analyses and derive actionable insights
	\item Conducted replication analysis by deploying national economic models at the state level, uncovered model sensitivity to share of workforce on furlough; also translated 20k+ lines of Stata code into R
      \item Wrote structural and reduced-form models to simulate/predict market conditions (e.g. cryptocurrency pricing, labor markets, etc)

\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
	%\item Cleaned, processed and analyzed large-scale datasets with over 10 million observations and 1000 variables, ensuring data integrity and accuracy of results
	\item Developed and implemented programs to estimate target parameters using five different estimators in a High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment, using data with over 10 million observations and 1000 variables
	\item Translated multiple projects with over 10,000 lines of code from one language to another (e.g.\ from Python to R and Stata)
	%\item Wrote programs to query APIs (e.g. World Bank\textquotesingle{}s World Development Indicators) and collect and save data for local processing
	\item Wrote programs to automatically update over 100 graphs, choropleth maps, and presentation slides with new data from API queries periodically
      %\item Documented code with comments and docstrings, flagged outdated code, added features, organized files, and updated references for multiple projects with cross-functional teams
	\item Collected, cleaned and, analyzed over 20 years of Census data with dozens of variables
      \item Collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate data analysis into broader strategic initiatives with versioning services like Git/Mercurial
        \item Refereed journal submissions for The Economic and Labour Relations Review

{\href{https://ptr-64.github.io/files/research\_projects/JMP/JMP\_draft.pdf}{\textbf{Effects of minimum wage reform on reservation wages}}} {\sl R, Python, Latex, SLURM, Excel} \hfill \\
Used quasi experimental designs (stacked event study designs, triple diff designs, etc) to show a 1\% increase in minimum wages lead to a 0.44-0.57\% increase in reservation wages (the lowest wages a worker will accept). These results reflect broader market conditions, with tighter labor markets and larger minimum wage increases associated with stronger reservation wage responses.\\ \vspace*{1mm} Accepted for presentation at the Midwest Economics Association 2024 conference, and the Western Economic Association International 99th Annual conference. \\

{\href{https://ptr-64.github.io/files/research\_projects/SYP/fnl\_drft.pdf}{\textbf{Effects of unemployment insurance generosity on unemployment}}} {\sl R, Stata, Latex, Sweve} \hfill \\
Replication of Gallant et. al 2020, in which I translated their Stata code into R, implemented their DMP model at the state level, and showed that terminating enhanced unemployment insurance early led to a 5\% fall in unemployment. Also found model predictions were sensitive to the share of workforce in furlough.\\
