## ECON2105 summary:

This course serves as an introduction to thinking about the macroeconomy by focussing on markets and how they operate. By looking at the statistical relationships that govern the laws of demand and supply, students are introduced to the critical thinking tools used by professional economists to forecast growth, inflation and other macroeconomic trends. A student should be able to understand the current debate on fiscal and monetary policy, trade deficits, and growth and engage with academic and journalistic material competently. 

## ECON2105 objectives:

  - Explain how basic macroeconomic indicators are calculated
  - Explain essential economic principles
  - Analyse how markets work and when they don’t
  - Analyse how fiscal and monetary shocks propagate through the economy
  - Use simple models to forecast unemployment and inflation
